### Contrib_schema
The following steps have been followed for making an example
 1. Analysis of the possible uses of the class
 2. Hints and conclussions about toxic language generation 


####  Functional Analysis
  * What can be used for ?
    1. Avoiding Toxicity . Decoding-based strategy. Defined by Jigsaw Perspective API defines toxicity [1](https://support.perspectiveapi.com/s/about-the-api-faqs?language=en_US) as a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make you leave a discussion.
    Defined by Pavlopoulus et al [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00998.pdf) as an "umbrella term" , compromising several subtypes, such as offensive, abusive, and hateful language.

        Conclusion : Broad term capturing various forms of offernsive, problematic or harmful language.
        Context matters when determining what´s toxic. Therefore it makes sense to have a class that allows us to control bad words with respect to context.
        Limitations : While the use of Bad words seem to indicate toxicity, language without such words can still be toxic.

    2. Blocklisting [3](). Block undesirable words , preventing them from being generated. Not necessarly toxic, but undesirable context dependent.
       Note that Blocklisting technique can come together with others as well.

    3. Focus: Focus the generation in certain topic or character instead of another. (example : focus in the duck, not in former president?). 

#### Hints about the impact of the class
    

  * Two mental models for designing examples
      1. Toxicity in Context .Design an example in which a certain word in certain context can be considered a bad word. Maybe not useful as this is thought for words and not exactly sequences.
      2. Detoxifying Generations. Take examples from research in REALTOXICITYPROMPTS [4](https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.301.pdf) and detoxify them.
      3. Avoiding certain sequences. For examples, missatributed quotes to historical characters that have been incorrectly missatributed.
      4. According to docs aboiding repetitive results in [default model configuration](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.30.0/generation_strategies#default-text-generation-configuration) NO Because that´s what RepetitionPenaltyLogitsProcessor do.
      5. See this documentation for knowing more


#### Class Analysis
  * Class Description. Find [NoBadWordsLogitsProccesor](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/f1732e1374a082bf8e43bd0e4aa8a2da21a32a21/src/transformers/generation/logits_process.py#L725)
    Apparently enforces that specified sequences will never be selected. 
    
  * Arguments
    * bad_words_ids . List of list of token ids that are not allowed to be generated.
    * eos_token_id . The id of the end-of-sequence token. Optionally, use a list to set multiple end-to-endsequence tokens.
  * History / Evolution . Discussions in [#22168](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/22168)

UserWarning: You have modified the pretrained model configuration to control generation. This is a deprecated strategy to control generation and will be removed soon, in a future version. Please use a generation configuration file (see https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/text_generation )
  warnings.warn(
The attention mask and the pad token id were not set. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.

This means that for using this parameter we might want to use or own pretrained model
